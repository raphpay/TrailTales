## Problem

Hikers and outdoor enthusiasts lack a comprehensive and user-friendly iOS application for documenting their hiking experiences and creating visually appealing journals. The existing hiking journal apps offer limited functionality and fail to meet the needs of nature lovers and outdoor influencers. There is a demand for an iOS app that seamlessly integrates text and photo entries, prioritizes user privacy, maintains an aesthetic connection with Apple's design principles, and caters to both one-time purchase users and those interested in subscribing for additional features.

## Solution

The solution to this problem is the development of a feature-rich iOS hiking journal app that addresses these challenges and objectives. This app will provide a valuable tool for hikers to document their experiences and share them with the world, all while adhering to high standards of user experience and privacy.
